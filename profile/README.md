# British Rowing (UK)

British Rowing is the governing body for the sport of rowing (both indoor rowing and rowing on water). We are committed to ensuring that the sport continues to thrive from the grassroots right up to winning medals at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.

We are responsible for participation and the development of rowing and indoor rowing in England and for the training and selection of individual rowers and crews representing Great Britain.
